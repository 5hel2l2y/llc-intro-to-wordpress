        ##Create a WordPress.com account [to do]

        To use WordPress, you will need to create an account first.  
        [Follow these instructions here](set-up.html) to create your WordPress.com account.
        
        <br>
        If you already have a WordPress account, take this time to gather some images.  Use your own photos, choose from the sample images contained in the folder you downloaded today [add sample images] or use stock photography.
        
        Here's a [list of resources](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b) for free stock photography.

        You may also need to resize your images.  We recommend [add sizes here]. [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/web) is a great free tool for image editing.

        ##Blog vs Website
        
        How are blogs are different from standard informational websites?
        
        * the term *blog* is actually an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing chronicle of posts and articles presented in chronological order
        * often (but not always) written in a diary-style of commentary
        * you can have a blog section as part of your website [reword?]

        Let’s look at some popular blogs:
        
        * [Stuck in Customs](http://www.stuckincustoms.com/)
        * [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/)
        * [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/)
        * [GOOP](http://goop.com/)

        ## What is a CMS?
    
        With a CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress, it's become much easier to start a blog and to get a website up and running.
        
        A CMS  makes it easy to add, edit and manage a website by providing a user interface for creating, modifying and publishing web content without editing the codebase.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes other features such as:

        * creating navigation elements
        * database management 
        * themes
        * and much more!
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        ##What is WordPress?
        
        Wordpress is:
        
        * one of many types of blogging software and CMS.
        * now powering 22% of the web (Source: Forbes.com)
        * an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool 
        * written primarily in PHP (programming language)
        
        There are two options for using WordPress and depending on your needs and which option you choose, you may not need to know much HTML/CSS/PHP to get up and running.
        
        However, the more customized the WordPress site is required to be, the more knowledge of these coding languages are needed.

        ##WordPress.com <span>vs</span> WordPress.org
        
        Wordpress offers two options for usage.
        
        **WordPress.org** offers more features, but the option you choose often depends on your needs, current skills and budget. **WordPress.com** is great if you don't want to worry about paying for hosting or managing a web server. It’s free and you still have some options for customizing your site or upgrade to access more features.
        
        You can also move an existing WordPress.com site to a self-hosted WordPress.org site when you're ready so starting with the free version is a good way to try out the platform first.
        
        Let's take a more detailed look at the different features for each option.

        ##The Dashboard

        The Dashboard allows access all options such as adding blog posts and pages, customizing the look of your site, uploading media and adding premium features. Access your Dashboard in two ways:

        **Option 1:**   
        Log in using your domain name and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL. It should look like this: https://yoursitename.wordpress.com/wp-admin/
        
        **Option 2:**  
        https://wordpress.com - Logging in here will take you to your **Reader**.  
        Select **My Sites** to get to your WordPress site.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-login-1.png)
        
        <br>
        Then choose **WP Admin** to access the Dashboard.

      <script type="text/template">
        ##The Dashboard: Homepage and Menus
        
        The homepage is an overview of your blog. You can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and much more. Just click on any of the options to get more detail. 

        The menus are contained on the left side of the page.  The various links will take you to different areas of the dashboard to add/edit content, change how your blog looks and add/edit other features.
        
        There are lots of menu options but in the next few slides, we'll focus on the most common options to get you up and running.

        When creating a WordPress.com account, you're also creating your WordPress public profile.  Let the community know who you are! 
        
        All of the information is optional, so only fill in what you’d like. In your dashboard menu, near the bottom, select **Users > My Profile**.
        
        Choose how your name displays as the author of a post or when you comment on another WordPress site. Upload an image for your Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) for your profile.

        ##Configure basic site settings

        When setting up your account, the default Site Title is your username. This can easily be changed.  
        In the dashboard, go to **Settings > General**, enter a title and a tagline and **Save Changes**. 
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-title-tagline.png) <!-- .element: width="80%" -->

        ![](framework/img/workshop/headings-example.png)
        
        Wait! Where's the tagline? 
        
        Your page might also look a little different than this example. That's because every theme displays the title and tagline a little differently (or sometimes not at all like this theme).

        ## What is a WordPress Theme?

        A theme provides all of the graphical styles for your site.  
        
        WordPress.com provides hundreds of themes for you to choose from. They are HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates so you can get a functional site without writing any code.
        
        Most themes include:

        * overall page layouts & colour scheme
        * styles for blog posts and blog archives
        * typography styles
        * different types of widgets and where they are located on the page
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Free vs Paid Themes
        
        So why would you learn to code or pay for a theme if there are so many free, functional templates to choose from?  Well, that all depends on how *unique* and *customized* you need your site to be.  Pre-built themes are a great way to get up and running when you're not quite sure yet what you need!
        
        If you're not ready to code yourself just yet but want more options, paid themes often offer premium plugins, more customization options and customer support.
        
        With WordPress.com, [you cannot upload your own themes](https://en.support.wordpress.com/themes/adding-new-themes/), but you can make some customizations to the themes that are available.  Since the .com version aims to keep things simple and require less technical maintenance for you, this feature is not supported (but you can with WordPress.org).

    <section class="slide resized" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Choosing a Theme
        
        Back in the dashboard, navigate to the **Appearance** menu option.  A sub-menu will appear to show all the appearance related options. In addition to picking a new theme, there are other options such as configuring widgets, customizing menus and the header, plus more.
        
        Let's look at **Themes** option first. The first theme that appears in the listing is your *active* theme. You can also filter the options to show only free or premium themes.

        There a many different themes to choose from with different styles.  Here are some features and options to look for when picking a theme:
        
        ###Responsive
        Look for a responsive theme so the design can adapt to different screen sizes for various devices.  A separate mobile site or mobile plugin will not be needed to resize or rearrange content for different sized screens.
        
        ###Columns
        
        Columns are basic website design elements. They allow you to display your content in chunks that are visually appealing. For example, you can have a larger main content area and a sidebar or use a layout that look like magazines and newspapers with more equal column widths.
        
        ###Page Layouts 
        Layout determines the look and feel of your blog.
        Also, choose a theme with subheading support.

        ##Post vs Pages
        
        ###Posts

        Using WordPress as a blog, you will use posts for majority of your site’s content

        Posts are timely content entries listed in reverse chronological order on your blog’s home page

        You can organize your posts based on categories and tags.


        ###Pages

        Pages are meant to be static “one-off” type content such as your about page, contact, legal disclaimers, etc.

        Pages can be organized into pages and subpages

        It is possible to remove all or most Posts from a WordPress installation, and thus to create a standard non-blog website.

        ## Categories & Tags

        Categories allow for a broad grouping of post topics

        Blog posts should clearly fit into a single category e.g., a food blog has recipes in the follow categories:
        Breakfast
        Lunch
        Dinner

        Tags are best used to create groups of content that apply to multiple categories. Tags give people the ability to navigate your site and quickly get to exactly what they want to find.

        Blog posts will often have multiple tags applied to them: 
        Bacon
        Quinoa
        Vegetarian
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Slug
        
        A slug is a few words, which you choose, to describe a post, page, category, or tag within WordPress. These words then appear as part of the URL (or Permalink) directing visitors to that content. 

        Here's a quick example: The title of this post is: A Straight-Forward Guide to WordPress Slugs.
        The URL is:

        ## What to Blog About: Finding a Niche

Challenge: The internet already has gazillions of blogs out there, and most of the popular ones deal mostly with general ideas, general niches

Solution: Focus on one small topic, just write about that small topic and promote the heck out of it. People who are interested in that topic will surely land on your “specialty blog” rather than on “general blogs” out there. Write about one thing, and do it really well.

Here’s an example of finding a niche:

General theme: Health & Fitness

Smaller niches are weight loss, healthy foods, sports, total well-being

We can take it one level further, especially for sports. Tennis, badminton, swimming, karate, and other sports that you can think of. 

Niche blogs make it easier to monetize your blog once you build up a solid following.


A few successful niche blogs:

Smitten Kitchen- Personal cooking in a small kitchen

Farmville Freak -  Hub of information for Farmville fans

Jezebel - Celebrity, Sex, Fashion for Women. Without Airbrushing.

Class discussion exercise:

Find a niche for your blog

Groups - each given major theme ie/ web design, fashion, food, etc

Narrow the niche, look online and come up with a micro-niche that has not yet been covered

Share niche with class

        ## Blogging Tips

        . Understand your Audience

        Have a clear understanding of your target audience. What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them? How can you bring value to your readers?

        Consider what you know about your target audience and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.


        2. Come Up with Great Topics

        Choose a working title 

        Develop a blog post outline

        Popular post types:
        The How-To Post
        The List-Based Post
        The Curated Collection Post

        3. Capture Their Attention

        Grab your reader’s attention in the intro.

        Tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic. Then describe the purpose of the post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be having.

        Use the journalism model of the “inverted pyramid.” Start with the content that is most important to your audience, and then provide additional details.

        4. Organize Your Content

        Organize the info to make it digestible and easy to read  - sections, lists, tips, whatever's most appropriate 

        Before you start writing, you know which points you want to cover, and the best order in which to do it

        Chunk your content to make it more scannable. Break it into manageable sections.


        5. Write, Write, Write! 

        http://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-typing-unpopular-opinion-13GIgrGdslD9oQ

        Write about what you already know, and if necessary, do additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Don’t forget to provide proper attribution when using external sources. 

        Be yourself- tell your story and be authentic

        Post length - 200 to 1000+ words

        Edit and proofread - then do it again!

        Develop clear calls to action. A few examples:
        Subscribe to our newsletter
        Get a quote
        Learn more
        Buy a service
        Leave a comment
        Download an ebook

        ## Create an Editorial Calendar

Publish minimum 1 post per week

Plan minimum 1-2 months in advance

Use Google Calendar or spreadsheet, or content management software 

The Editorial Calendar Wordpress plugin makes it possible to see all your posts and drag and drop them to manage your blog
