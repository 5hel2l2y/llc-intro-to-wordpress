        ##Blog vs Website
        
        How are blogs different from standard websites?
        
        * the term *blog* is actually an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing collection of posts and articles presented in chronological order
        * often (but not always) written in a diary-style of commentary
        * a website can also contain a blog and standard informational pages
        
        <br>
        Let’s look at some popular blogs. What do you think makes a blog popular?
        
        * [Stuck in Customs](http://www.stuckincustoms.com/)
        * [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/)
        * [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/)
        * [GOOP](http://goop.com/)
        * [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/)

        ## Why Should I Start a Blog?
        
        * Drive traffic to your website
        * Convert that traffic into leads or sales

        * Create community

        ## What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS), is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface.
        
        Web content can be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:

        * creating site navigation elements
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!

        ##What is WordPress?
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-logo.png)
        
        * one of many types of blogging software and CMS.
        * now powering 22% of the web (Source: Forbes.com)
        * an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool 
        * written primarily in PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
        * uses PHP templates & a database to create and store content (with static HTML, you have to manually create a new document for every new page)
        
        <br>
        Depending on your needs and level of customization, you may not need to edit any of the code to get up and running.
        
        There are two options for using WordPress, WordPress.**org** and WordPress.**com**.

        ##Exercise - Account setup (10-15mins)
        
        1. If you *do not* have a WordPress.com account, [follow these instructions](set-up.html).
      
        1. If you *do* have a WordPress.com account, take this time think about what you'd like to blog about and gather some images.  
          * use your own photos
          * choose from some sample images [here](images.zip) (zip file)
          <!-- * choose from the sample images contained in today's learner files  
            found in the **llc-intro-to-wordpress > images** folder. -->
          * use stock photography - here's a [list of resources](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b) for free stock photography.
        
        <br>
        You may also need to resize your images. Large images may slow down your site and small images may get pixelated so we recommend sizing your "large" images around 800px wide. 
        
        [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/web) is a great free tool for image editing.

        ##The Dashboard

        The Dashboard allows access to options such as adding blog posts,  pages, changing themes, uploading media and adding premium features and more. 
        
        Access your Dashboard in two ways:
        
        **Option 1:**  Log in using your domain name and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL.  
        It should look like this: `https://yoursitename.wordpress.com/wp-admin/`
        
        **Option 2:** https://wordpress.com  
        This login will take you to your **Reader**. Select **My Sites** to get to your WordPress site.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-login-1.png)
        
        <br>
        Then choose **WP Admin** to access the Dashboard.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-login-2.png)
        
        Note that the Dashboard looks and the works the same in both the **.com** and **.org** version of Wordpress, though some of the options may be different based on customizations.

      <script type="text/template">
        ##The Dashboard: Home
        
        Logging into the admin area will automatically take you the the Dashboard Home page. Here, you can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and get a general overview of your blog. 
        
        Click on any of the options to see more detail.

        ## The Dashboard
        
        The various menus contain links to different areas of the CMS to edit content, change how your blog looks and add/edit other features. There are **lots** of menu options but today we'll focus on the most common options to get you up and running.  Some areas to be covered are:
        
        * setting up a public profile
        * configuring basic settings
        * adding content - pages vs posts
        * publishing options

        ##Class Exercise: Set up your Public Profile
        
        Your WordPress.com account is also your WordPress public profile. Choose how your name displays as the author of a post or when you comment on another WordPress site. You can also upload an image for your Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) for your profile. All of the information is optional, so only fill in what you’d like.
        
        In the menu, near the bottom, select **Users > My Profile** to update.

        ##Class Exercise: Configure basic site settings

        When setting up your account, the default Site Title is your username. This can easily be changed.  
        In the dashboard, go to **Settings > General**, enter a title and a tagline and **Save Changes**. 
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-title-tagline.png) <!-- .element: width="80%" -->
        
        You can also set your timezone, date/time format and language options here as well.

        ##View your site
        
        Now that you've made some changes, how do you actually *see* your site?  
        
        Go to **My Sites > View Site**.

        ##View your site
        
        The page layout will vary based on the theme. Also, the admin bar and *edit* link only shows when logged into your Wordpress account to allow access to the admin options.  Your blog readers will not see these options. This is what the sample LLC site looks like using the "Edin" theme.

        Some themes don't include support for certain types of content (e.g. the tagline in the previous example). When choosing a theme, you can view and test out different customization options. 
        
        Let's talk about the different ways to add content first, before choosing & customizing a theme. To get back to your admin dashboard, select **My Site > WP Admin**

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Pages
        
        WordPress includes an option for creating standard static pages.  
        The **Pages** option can be used for "one-off" type of content such as an about or contact page.
        
        To add a page, select **Pages > Add New**
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/pages-1.png) <!-- .element: width="310" -->
        
        After adding the content, click the **Update** button.  The URL will be generated after the page is saved and is referred to as the **Permalink**.  Remember to **Update** every time an edit is made.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Posts
        
        To use WordPress for blog posts, **Posts** are used to create time-based content entries. Posts can also be organized by **categories** and/or **tags**. 
        
        These options can be found under the Post menu.  Also, note that the permalink is automatically generated as well but since posts are time-based, the date of the post is included in the URL.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-posts.png)
        
        By default, blog posts will appear on the home page, your domain URL.  
        (e.g. https://ladieslearningcode.wordpress.com/)
        
        It is also possible to use a static page as the home page. More on changing this setting later.
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Post Options: Categories

        **Categories** allow for a broad grouping of post topics. Blog posts should fit into a single category.  For example, a food blog can have recipes in the following categories: Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.
        
        To add categories, go to **Posts > Categories **
        
        Sub-categories can also be created by choosing an option listed under **Parent**.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-categories.png)

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Post Options: Categories
        
        Categories can also be added when editing a Post as well.
          
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-categories-post.png)
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Post Options: Tags
        
        **Tags** are best used to create groups of content that can apply to multiple categories and be more specific. This gives people the ability to navigate your site quickly and find exactly what they want.  For example, a frittata recipe can have the following category and tags:
        
        * Category: Breakfast 
        * Tags: eggs, kid friendly, under 30mins
        
        Just like categories, tags can be added from the menu or when editing a post.  But unlike categories, tags *cannot* have a hierarchy.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-tags.png) <!-- .element: width="600" -->
        
        In addition to adding new tags from the post, existing tags will show with an underline in the *add* field.  Click on "Choose from the most used tags" to see tags that have been used in other posts.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/tags.png) <!-- .element: width="300" -->
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Featured image
        
        For both posts and pages, you can also set a featured image.  This will make your blogs more visually appealing.  We'll talk more about the different ways to use images later but for now, you can find this feature on both the post and pages edit screen.

        ## Group Exercise - Brainstorm (15mins)

        In groups of 2 or 3, brainstorm and discuss the below points with your neighbors.
        
        1. Think of a blog post you'd like to write about.
        1. What category and tags would you use?

        ## Adding content: Visual editor

        When adding content into your Post or Page, the default visual editor uses a WYSIWYG editor (what you see is what you get) to format the content.  Click on the **Toolbar Toggle** to show all of the editing options.  Hover over any icon to see a short description of what each tool is used for.

      ## Adding content: Text
      
      When using the Visual editor, the content entered automatically gets converted into HTML.  
      You can also edit or add your own HTML using the Text editor. 
      
      ![](framework/img/workshop/editor-visual.png)
      ![](framework/img/workshop/editor-text.png)
      
      In the above example, the Text editor shows the link is surrounded by an `<a>` tag and the heading tag uses an `<h2>` like so:
       
          <a title="Direct link to Add New Post in your Dashboard" href="https://wordpress.com/post">start a new post</a>

        ## HTML Syntax
        
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to assign meaning to content using *tags* to create HTML elements to tell the browser how to interpret the content.

            <p>This is a paragraph because it's using a "p" tag.</p>
        
        * angled brackets `< >` represent HTML tags  
        * almost all elements have an *opening* tag `<p>` and a matching *closing* tag `</p>`
        * Note the forward slash `/` used in the closing tag.

        ## HTML Headings
        
        There are 6 heading tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.   
        These heading levels follow a hierarchical structure.

            <h1>Most Important Heading</h1>
            <h2>Second Most Important Heading</h2>
            ...
        ---

      <script type="text/template">
        ## HTML Links
            
        In HTML, use the `<a>` tag for links. Wrap the tag around the word(s) to be used as the target for the link. The below example shows the HTML as well as how it displays in the browser. 
          
            Click <a>here</a> for more info.
            
        <div class="example" style="padding: 10px;">
          Click <a style="border:none;">here</a> for more info.
        </div>
        
        Some tags require more information in the form of *attributes*. If you click the above example link, it won't go anywhere. Links require the addition of an `href` *attribute* to specify where to link to. 
        
        A `title` *attribute* is optional but can also be added to provide extra info about the link.  The content in the `title` *attribute* also appears as a "tool tip" when you hover over the link.

            Click <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com" title="Ladies Learning Code website">here</a> for more info.

        ## HTML Paragraphs
        
        Paragraphs are very common in HTML documents. However, adding HTML into the WordPress editor is a *little* different than writing pure HTML. Normally, paragraphs would be written like this:
        
            <p>I'm a paragraph with only one sentence.</p>
            <p>I'm another paragraph.  And I have more than one sentence! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ducimus molestias sequi voluptas voluptatem ipsam totam.</p>
        
        In Wordpress, you don't need to add the `<p>` tags in either the visual **or** text editor. In the visual editor, select the paragraph option from the dropdown.  In the Text editor, just ensure you return/enter twice to add a space between the paragraphs.  They will automatically be converted into `<p>` tags via Wordpress magic!

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## HTML line break
        
        Line breaks are usually used to add a new line to a group of text where the division of lines are needed but not as a new paragraph. (e.g. poem or an address) Line breaks are created using the break tag `<br>`. 
        
        A paragraph written like the example below will be rendered as one line because HTML doesn't read more than one white space or new lines.
        
            <p>
              123 Anywhere St., 
              City, Province
              A3C 1H5
            </p>
        
        <p class="example" style="padding: 10px;">123 Anywhere St., City, Province A3C 1H5</p>
        
        But with line break tags, it will look like this:
          
            <p>
              123 Anywhere St.,<br> 
              City, Province<br> 
              A3C 1H5
            </p>
            
        <p class="example" style="padding: 10px;">
          123 Anywhere St.,<br> 
          City, Province<br> 
          A3C 1H5
        </p>
        But, like paragraphs, in the WordPress editor, break tags `<br>` are also not needed.  Just use the enter/return key *once* for a line break in either the visual or text WordPress editor.

        ## HTML & Wordpress
        
        Even though the WordPress editor doesn't require some of these specific HTML tags, you can still add them. 
        
        The text editor will accept the `<p>`, `<br>` and other HTML tags if included. Some people may prefer to do that to have more control over the HTML formatting.
          
        Just note that it is not required and the visual editor can be used instead.

        ## Exercise - Add some content (15mins)
        
        We know writing takes time so use some placeholder text for now! Here is a big list of placeholder text you can use: http://meettheipsums.com/ &mdash; We just need some content to work with for the upcoming theme exercises so don't worry about finding or changing your theme just yet. 
        
        1. Add at least one page.  (e.g. About page)
        2. Add at least two blog posts. Use categories and tags.
        
        Here's how your page may look (this example is still using the "Edin" theme).  Note how the different types of content appear (blog content, category, tags, etc).

        ## Slug: Posts & Pages
        
        A WordPress **slug** is a few words used to describe a post, page, category, or tag within WordPress. 
        
        In posts and pages, the slug appears in the URL and is generated automatically based on the title. It can be changed manually to something different from the title but it's best to keep them simple and relevant. 
        
        Select **Edit** to change it manually.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-slug-automatic.png)
        
        Only the highlighted portion is classified as the slug and can be changed.

        Slugs can also be used in categories and tags and are also automatically generated. 
      
        Note that the WordPress**.com** version does not have an option to manually update the slug for categories and tags but the WordPress**.org** version does.
        
        Slugs can be found under the **Post > Categories** or **Post > Tags** menu.  Though your tag & category names can contain spaces and special characters, it will be converted to a dash for the slug to make it URL friendly.

        ## What is a WordPress Theme?

        A theme provides all of the graphical styles for your site.  
        
        WordPress.com provides hundreds of themes for you to choose from. They are HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates so you can get a functional website without writing any code.
        
        Most themes include:

        * overall page layouts & colour scheme
        * styles for blog posts and blog archives
        * typography styles
        * different types of widgets and where they are located on the page
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Free & Paid Themes
        
        So why would you learn to code or pay for a theme if there are so many free, functional templates to choose from?  Well, that all depends on how *unique* and *customized* you need your site to be.  
        
        Pre-built themes are a great way to get up and running and to try it out, and can help determine what you need before investing in development or paid themes. 
        
        If you're not ready to code yourself just yet but want more options, paid themes often offer premium plugins, more customization options and customer support.
        
        <br>
        With WordPress.com, [you cannot upload your own themes](https://en.support.wordpress.com/themes/adding-new-themes/), but you can still make some customizations to the themes that are available.  The **.com** version aims to keep things simple and require less technical maintenance, so this feature is not supported (but you can with the **.org** version).

        ##Choosing a Theme
        
        There a many different themes to choose from with different styles.  Here are some features and options to look for when picking a theme:
        
        ###Responsive
        Look for a responsive theme so the design can adapt to different screen sizes for various devices.  A separate mobile site or mobile plugin will not be needed to resize or rearrange content for different sized screens.
        
        ###Columns
        
        Columns are basic website design elements. They allow you to display your content in chunks that are visually appealing. For example, you can have a larger main content area and a sidebar or use a layout that look like magazines and newspapers with more equal column widths.
        
        ###Page Layouts 
        Layout determines the overall look and feel of your blog.  Consider how (or if) certain content is displayed such as the site title, subheading, tags, categories, main menu, etc.

    <section class="slide resized" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Choosing a Theme
        
        Back in the dashboard, navigate to the **Appearance** menu option.  A sub-menu will appear to show all the appearance related options. In addition to picking a new theme, there are other options such as configuring widgets, customizing menus and the header, plus more.
        
        Let's look at **Themes** option first. The first theme that appears in the listing is your *active* theme. You can also filter the options to show only free or premium themes.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/theme-details.png)  
          
        Select the **Preview** button from either screen to see how the theme looks with your content.  The options on the left menu contain customizations and will vary among different themes. 
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/theme-preview.png)

        You can also access these theme customization options from the Dashboard under **Appearance > Customize**. To update the theme changes, select **Save & Activate**.

        ## Exercise - Choose a theme
        
        Make sure to have some content and at least one featured image in a post and/or page to help see the the theme options.
        
        Some themes will allow the option of adding your own colours using a **hex** value.  Hex values contain the number/hash symbol and 6 digits using the letters A-F and the numbers 0-9 and will looking something like this: `#ecf0f1`.  See below for colour resources.

        * https://coolors.co/
        
        <br>
        You will likely change themes as you add more actual content but take some time to explore the customizations and available options. (The LLC sample project uses the **Ecto** theme.)

        The menu location may vary depending on the theme.  Some themes also offer additional menus such as social links menus.

        By default, the blog posts will show as your home page (e.g. https://yoursite.wordpress.com/)
        
        Blog posts are listed in chronological order. [See example here](framework/img/workshop/homepage-default.jpg).

        ![](framework/img/workshop/homepage-blog.jpg)

        ##General Tips & Tricks
        
        **Clear your browser's cache**:
        
        When visiting a webpage, your browser temporarily stores items for future use to make the page load faster when you visit it again.
        
        If you are making multiple edits in a short amount of time, you may need to clear the browser's cache to delete the stored files with your new files.

        ## What to Blog About: Finding a Niche

        **Challenge**: The internet already has gazillions of blogs out there, and most of the popular ones deal mostly with general ideas, general niches

        **Solution**: Focus on one small topic, just write about that small topic and promote the heck out of it. People who are interested in that topic will surely land on your “specialty blog” rather than on “general blogs” out there. Write about one thing, and do it really well.
        
        <br>
        Here’s an example of finding a niche:

        **General theme**: Health & Fitness  
        **Smaller niches**: weight loss, healthy foods, sports, total well-being

        We can take it one level further, especially for sports. 

        **General theme**: Health & Fitness    
        **Smaller niches**: Sports  
        **Niche within a niche**: Tennis, badminton, swimming, karate, and other sports that you can think of.

        ## What to Blog About: Finding a Niche
        
        Niche blogs make it easier to monetize your blog once you build up a solid following.

        A few successful niche blogs:
        
        <div class="col-3">
          [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/) - Personal cooking in a small kitchen
          ![](framework/img/workshop/smitten-kitchen.jpg)
        </div>
        <div class="col-3">
          [Farmville Freak](http://farmvillefreak.com/) -  Hub of information for Farmville fans
          ![](framework/img/workshop/farmville-freak.jpg)

        ## Group exercise: Finding a Niche (20mins)
        
        For this exercise, practice finding a niche for your blog by brainstorming and doing some research.
        
        1. In groups of 2 or 3, narrow your given niche.
        1. Do some research online and come up with a micro-niche that has not yet been covered. Get specific!  i.e./ Tennis for weight loss, fashion for New England females
        1. Share your micro-niche with the class.

        ##Exercise: Understand your Audience (10mins)

        Having a clear understanding of your target audience is your key to success. Consider what you know about your target audience and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.

        Consider: 
        
        * What do they want to know about? 
        * What will resonate with them? 
        * What are their interests?
        * How can you bring value to your readers?
        * What problem can you solve for them?
        
        Create Your Persona:

        * List the characteristics of your target audience and create a specific persona 
        * Be specific! List age, gender, geographic area, education, marital status, interests, lifestyle characteristics - the more details, the better! 
        * Share with your neighbors & the class

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Capture Their Attention

        Grab your reader’s attention in the intro. Tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic. Then describe the purpose of the post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be having.

        Use the journalism model of the “inverted pyramid.” Start with the content that is most important to your audience, and then provide additional details.
        
        Examples of catchy leads (ledes):
        
        >Have you ever wondered how you would survive if you found yourself alone in the wilderness? How would you defend yourself against predators? What would you eat? Where would you find water?
        
        ---
        >“What am I doing wrong?” I whispered to the computer screen.
        >A part of me wanted nothing more than to go to bed and forget about blogging forever.
        >And yet, there I was, hunched over the computer, as I dug through my traffic stats for the millionth time. Somewhere inside was the answer to why I wasn’t getting more traffic, and I was going to find it.

        ##Organize Your Content

        Organize the info to make it digestible and easy to read.  Use sections, lists, tips, whatever is most appropriate.  Before you start writing, know which points you want to cover and the best order in which to do it.

        Chunk your content to make it more scannable. Break it into manageable sections.  
        In the example below, which one is easier to read?

        ##Exercise: Come Up with Great Topics (10mins)
        
        Choose a working title for your next blog post - you can refine your title later.

        Develop a blog post outline:

        1. Write down all the things you want your readers to get out of the article - brain dump!
        1. Break up those takeaways into larger sections - take that jumble of ideas and place them into overarching sections (some suggest 3-4 sections as a benchmark)
        1. Add more takeaways to some sections - your outline may look weird, but that’s ok!
        1. Revise, remove, and reorganize details in each section - reorganize the information to tell the most logical story
        1. Spruce up the outline with any additional details, anecdotes or information that you don't want to forget while writing (especially important if you write the post at a later date)
        
        Popular post types:

        * The How-To Post 
        * The List-Based Post 
        * The Curated Collection Post
        * Interview With An Expert

        ##Write, Write, Write! 
        
        Write about what you already know, and if necessary, do additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points. Don’t forget to provide proper attribution when using external sources. 

        * Be yourself! Tell your story and be authentic.
        * Recommended post length - 200 to 1000+ words.
        * Edit and proofread - then do it again!
        * Develop clear calls to action. A few examples:
          * Subscribe to our newsletter
          * Get a quote
          * Learn more
          * Buy a service
          * Leave a comment

        ## Create an Editorial Calendar

        Set a schedule and keep to it - feed the beast!

        Categorize your content according to genres. Some examples:
        
        * event announcements
        * new product release 
        * how-to pieces 
        * notable interviews

        Publish minimum 1 post per week.

        Plan minimum 1-2 months in advance.

        Use Google Calendar, spreadsheet, or content management software to help plan your schedule. 

        The [Editorial Calendar Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/) makes it possible to see all your posts and drag and drop them to manage your blog (Remember, plugins are only available in self-hosted Wordpress sites.)

        ## The Power of Images & Video
        
        Visual appeal is crucial.
        
        In addition to breaking up you content into lists and digestable chunks, use images or infographics to visually represent ideas in the content.

        Some options in Wordpress are:
        
        * image galleries
        * static images
        * feature image

        Here are some resources for royalty free images:

        ## The Power of Images & Video

        Videos add life to your blog posts and is great for SEO (search engine optimization). Embed third-party videos in WordPress blog posts or add your own from YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion & more.
        
        To add images or videos, from your post, select the **Add Media** button and you will be presented with various options.  Also, under the **Media** menu, you can manage your files.

        ## Search Engine Optimization 
        
        SEO works to boosting visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results

        Often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results

        Higher search rankings = more traffic
        
        Keywords are key! 
        
        <br>
        The best keywords have:
        
        * Strong relevance: terms for which you have content to support
        * Relatively high search volume: terms people actually search for
        * Relatively low competition: terms with a small number of search results

      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## SEO Keywords

        Think about your keywords as search terms &mdash; how would someone looking for information on this topic search for it?

        Brainstorm a list of the words and phrases a searcher might use to find your site or business

        Be specific! Instead of broad terms like “shoes” focus on “wedding shoes”, “pink suede ballerina flats” or “black patent leather high-heeled pumps” 

        Use keywords and phrases in your web content that make it possible for people to find your site via search engines.

        Hyperlink SEO keywords to relevant web pages and other blog posts in the series

        ## SEO Tips for Multimedia

        Search engines can’t “read” anything other than plain old text.

        Place appropriate keywords throughout every aspect of your site: your titles, content, URLs, and image names.

        Give media files clear, descriptive names.  Don’t forget to add more descriptive text (or meta data) to the “alt” attribute in the file’s tag.

        Photos should be rendered in jpg format, logos should be gif files.
