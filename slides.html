        ##Blog vs Website

        The term *blog* is actually an abbreviation for *weblog*. 

        How are blogs are different from standard informational websites?
        
        * often contains an ongoing chronicle of posts and articles
        * often (but not always) written in a diary-style of commentary
        * posts or entries are presented in chronological order
        
        <br>
        With CMS systems like WordPress, it's become much easier to start a blog and to get a website up and running.

        ## What is a CMS?
    
        A CMS (Content Management System) makes it easy for users to add, edit and manage a website by providing a user interface for creating, modifying and publishing web content.

        Not only do content management systems help with content editing, they also take care of other things such as:

        * creating navigation elements
        * database management 
        * themes
        * and much more!

        ##What is WordPress?

        WordPress is one of many types of blogging software and CMS (Content Management System).

        WordPress is an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool written primarily in the PHP programming language. 

        There are two versions of WordPress and depending on your needs and which option you choose, you may not necessarily need to know much HTML/CSS/PHP to get up and running.

        Note that the more customized the WordPress site is, the more knowledge of these coding languages are required.

        ##WordPress.com vs WordPress.org

        Though Wordpress.org offers more features, the option you choose often depends on your needs, current skills and budget. 

        If you don't want to pay for hosting, manage your own web server or pay someone else to do that for you, you’ll probably want to use WordPress.com. It’s free and you still have options for customizing your site.

        WordPress.com also offer several premium upgrades, including domain name registration (if you don’t want WordPress.com in your domain name), the ability to upload videos and if access to their premium themes.

        You can also easily move your existing WordPress.com site to a self-hosted WordPress.org site when you're ready.

        ##The Dashboard

        The Dashboard is where you access all options available such as adding blog posts and pages, customizing the look of your site, uploading media and adding premium features. Access your Dashboard in two ways:

        **Option 1:**   
        Log in using your domain name and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL. It should look like this: https://yoursitename.wordpress.com/wp-admin/
        
        <br>
        **Option 2:**  
        https://wordpress.com - Logging in here will take you to your **Reader**. Select **My Sites** to get to your WordPress site.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/dashboard-login-1.png)
        
        <br>
        Then choose **WP Admin** to access the Dashboard.

      <script type="text/template">
        ##The Dashboard: The Homepage and Menus
        
        The homepage is an overview of your blog. You can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and much more. Just click on any of the options to get more detail. 

        On the left side of the page contains the menus.  The various links will take you to different areas of the dashboard to add/edit content, change how your blog looks and add/edit other features.
        
        There are lots of menu options but in the next few slides, we'll focus on the most common options to get you up and running.

        When creating a WordPress.com account, you're also creating your WordPress public profile.  Let the community know who you are! 
        
        You can choose how your name displays as the author of a post or when you comment on another WordPress site. Upload an image for your Gravatar (“Globally Recognized Avatar”) which will appear next to your name.
        
        All this information is totally optional, so only fill in what you’d like. In your dashboard menu, near the bottom, select **Users > My Profile**.

        When setting up your account, the default title is your username. This can easily be changed, as often as you need! Back in the dashboard menu, go to **Settings > General**, enter a title and your new tagline. 
        
        You can also set your timezone, date/time format and language options.

        Wait! Where's the tagline? 
        
        Your page might also look a little different than this example. That's because every theme displays the title and tagline a little differently (or sometimes not a all like in this theme).

        ## What is a WordPress Theme?

        A theme provides all of the graphical styles for your site and WordPress.com provides hundreds for you to choose from. 
        
        They are HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates so you can get a functional site without writing any code.
        
        Most themes include:

        * overall page layouts & colour scheme
        * styles for blog posts and blog archives
        * typography styles
        * different types of widgets and where they are located on the page
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Free vs Paid Themes
        
        So why would you learn to code or pay for a theme if there are so many free, functional templates to choose from?  Well, that all depends on how *unique* and *customized* you need your site to be.  Pre-built themes are a great way to get up and running when you're not quite sure yet what you need!
        
        <br>
        If you're not ready to code yourself just yet, paid themes often offer premium plugins, more customization options and customer support.
        
        <br>
        With WordPress.com, [you cannot upload your own themes](https://en.support.wordpress.com/themes/adding-new-themes/), but you can make some customizations to the themes that are available.  Since the .com version aims to keep things simple and require less technical maintenance for you, this feature is not supported (but you can with WordPress.org).

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Choosing a Theme
        
        Back in the dashboard, navigate to the **Appearance** menu option.  A sub-menu will appear.
        
        Under this menu, in addition to picking a new theme, there are many other options related to changing the appearance of your blog such as configuring widgets and customizing menus and the header to name a few things.   
        
        Let's look at **Themes** first. The first theme that appears in the listing is your *active* theme. You can also filter the options to show only free or premium themes.

        ##Getting your site online

        You will need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are a couple domain & hosting suggestions:
        
        * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - Domain registration
        * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - Domain and hosting - Use coupon code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!

        To get your files online, you will need upload your files to your newly purchased hosting server. There are a few pieces of information you will need and are usually provided to you by your hosting service provider.

        * FTP Address
        * Username
        * Password

        Here's a nice tutorial getting your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
